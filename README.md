# Data Analysis with Python 🐍
[FreeCodeCamp Course - Data Analysis with Python](
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/)

Throughout the course, I have learned essential techniques and tools for data manipulation, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. I am now equipped with the ability to analyze data effectively.

1. **Data manipulation and cleaning:** Gained expertise in handling and transforming data, dealing with missing values, and addressing inconsistencies in datasets.
2. **Exploratory data analysis:** Learned techniques to explore and visualize data, identify patterns, and uncover insights using tools like Pandas and Matplotlib.
3. **Data visualization:** Learned how to create visually appealing and informative data visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate insights effectively.
4. **Working with libraries:** Gained familiarity with popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, and learned how to leverage their functionalities for data analysis tasks.

Dedicated to apply my new skills to solve real-world data analysis challenges 💪🏽!
